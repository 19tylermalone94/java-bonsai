# java-bonsai
randomly generated pixel-art bonsai

Cool little bonsai generator written in java. It uses java swing library over a simple video game style loop.
I have to give credit to John Allbritin for the cbonsai, which was my inspiration. You can check his
out at gitlab: https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai. If you adjust the alpha, you could also use this for tree sprite 
generation for 2d games.
