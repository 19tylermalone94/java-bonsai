# java-bonsai
randomly generated pixel-art bonsai

I really like cbonsai by John Allbritin (https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai), and I wanted to make a bonsai generator using pixels instead. This is a random bonsai generator written in Java. Currently it is installable on archlinux systems, but I will set up packages for other systems in the near future.

For archlinux users:

clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/19tylermalone94/java-bonsai.git
```


change directory into package:

```cd java-bonsai```


use makepkg to build and install:

```makepkg -si```


now you should be able to run the program from anywhere in your system directory by running the command ```java-bonsai`` in your terminal
