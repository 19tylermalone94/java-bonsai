randomly generated pixel-art bonsai

I really like cbonsai by John Allbritin (https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai), and I wanted to make a bonsai generator using pixels instead. This is a random bonsai generator written in Java. Currently it is installable on archlinux systems, but I will set up packages for other systems in the near future.

For archlinux users:

clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/19tylermalone94/java-bonsai.git
```


change directory into package:

```bash
cd java-bonsai
```


use makepkg to build and install:

```bash
makepkg -si
```


now run this command in your terminal from any directory:

```bash
java-bonsai
```


Press ENTER to generate new bonsai trees. Enjoy!
